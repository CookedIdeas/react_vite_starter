### React vite starter

You won't find good design here, but you'll find a nice react project starter with following features :

## Components

- Router in App.jsx → ready to have new routes and loaders, error element nested in layout
- Layout, Header, Footer, Navbar → everything placing nicely depending on navbar width (navbar width is set in HomeLayout.jsx)
- An instance of redux store is set (with userSlice)
- Styling with TailwindCSS
- Ready to use packages : react-icons, sonner, @tanstack/react-query (see code in utils/reactQuery.jsx)
